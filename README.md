# CTGOV Compliance Web Application

This project provides a basic Flask web interface for viewing clinical
trial compliance information. It also includes supporting scripts and
database services.

## Components

- **Flask** application located in `web/`.
- **PostgreSQL** for application data.
- **Flyway** for database migrations.

## Requirements

- **NixOS** must be downloaded onto the system
  - Run in Terminal (MacOS):

    ```{bash}
    sh <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
    ```

  - [Windows Instructions](https://nixos.org/download/#nix-install-windows)
- **UV** must be downloaded onto the system
  - Run in your CLI with Homebrew:

    ```{bash}
    brew install uv
    ```

  - Alternatively, you may use the following:

    ```{bash}
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

## Usage

```bash
nix develop
```

This command will download all dependencies and set up the development environment.

### File Cleanup

Running the command below will delete files autogenerated by the `nix develop` command. It will also kill the PostgreSQL server.

```bash
source scripts/flake/clean.sh
```

### Mock Data

_Not required; ran using `nix develop`_

For convenience a helper script is included to load mock organizations,
users, trials and compliance information into PostgreSQL.

```bash
python scripts/init_mock_data.py
```

### Running the Flask App

_Not required; ran using `nix develop`_

After the services are running and mock data is loaded you can start the
development server:

```bash
flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6525
```

#### Development Auto-Authentication

For development convenience, you can enable automatic user authentication:

```bash
# For local development
export ENVIRONMENT=dev
flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6525

# For preview deployments (single PR testing)
export ENVIRONMENT=preview
flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6525
```

When `ENVIRONMENT=dev` or `ENVIRONMENT=preview` is set, you'll be automatically logged in as `user1@example.com` when visiting any protected route. This eliminates the need for manual login during development and testing.

**Environment Flow**: `preview` (single PR) → `dev` (main branch) → `prod` (tagged release)

### Account Management

You can create an account directly in the application and reset your password when needed.

1. Visit `/register` to sign up for a new account.
2. Use `/reset` to generate a password reset link.

## Cloud Database Setup

This application supports both local development databases and Google Cloud SQL for production deployments.

### Quick Start for Cloud

1. **Set up Cloud SQL instance** and configure GitHub secrets
2. **Deploy application** using existing GitHub Actions
3. **Initialize database** with mock data using the "Initialize Cloud Database" GitHub Action
4. **Verify setup** by accessing your Cloud Run service

For detailed setup instructions, see [Cloud Database Setup Guide](docs/CLOUD_DATABASE_SETUP.md).

### Key Features

- **Automatic connection handling** (local vs Cloud SQL)
- **One-time data population** with safety mechanisms
- **GitHub Actions integration** for automated deployment
- **Population status tracking** to prevent duplicate data
- **Force repopulation** when needed for testing

### Scripts

- `scripts/init_cloud_data.py` - Safely populate cloud database with mock data
- `scripts/check_db_status.py` - Check database population status
- Use GitHub Actions workflow "Initialize Cloud Database" for automated setup
